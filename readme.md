# capstone
E-commerce website which is intended to sell bread and boba tea products. My website includes 5 different html pages linked to the home page. I've learned how to utilize bootstrap to create my website more efficiently. I have also learned how to use other bootstrap templates and reverse engineering the templates to gain a better understanding of how the code works.

Two challenges I've had encountered during my project:
1. Planning out design ideas on how to format the website.
2. Sticking footer in the middle of the page while scrolling down.

Things I have enjoyed:

* Collaborating with peers
+ Creative design for logos and images to implement
